## The code

### Things to note:
* This application `10cbazbt3.py` is being developed on a Raspberry Pi *using Python 3.*
* The code and dependent files are stored in: `~/home/pi/10cv4/` - the directory is mentioned in each subroutine.
* It also currently uses my site's ID in the `post()` subroutine.
* There's a way to go before this is as 'modular' as I'd like.
* What there is, it works *provided a valid developer auth token is used.*
* What there is, it's a noob's first attempt at proper Python *and* interacting with an API.  Please tread carefully.
