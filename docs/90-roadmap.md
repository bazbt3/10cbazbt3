# Roadmap
A list of the plans and would-be-nice-to-haves for this project.

## Version numbers:
* **`0.1.x`** - From first upload through a testing phase of the post-only client,
* **`0.2.x`** - (ongoing) Creation of timeline listings, bugs and bug fixes,
* `0.3.x` - (planning) - Likely to introduce better timeline handling; ideally forward and reverse-scrolling,

The future may include a GUI and conversion to a Python-independent executable client, but currently it's nowhere near ready for that.
