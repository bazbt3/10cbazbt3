````

Self-explanatory, right?  No, not yet.

## A brief primer:

### `b = Blurb (social post)`:
Easy:

1. Type `b`, press [enter],
1. Read the prompt, write some text, press [enter],
1. The post appears at 10C.

---

### `p = Post (blog post)`:
Not quite as straightforward as a Blurb:

1. Type `p`, press [enter],
1. Read the first prompt, write a blog post title, press [enter],
1. Read the second prompt, write some text, some more text, press [enter] as many times as you like - *entry continues,*
1. **To post your text**, ensure your cursor is on a blank line and press [ctrl-d].

#### Before blogging for the first time:
Important: Please read through the code comments.  The code is currently tailored specifically to *my* Raspberry Pi's folder structure.  It's also setup to post to only *my* blog - see the 'post' subroutine for the variable to edit - *after* running **'sites'** and examining the API feedback.

### `r = Reply`:
Needs a post number to reply to:

1. Type `r`, press [enter],
1. Read the prompt,
1. Enter the post number you wish to reply to,
1. Write some text, press [enter].

---

### `m = get Mentions`:
Relatively easy to work with:

1. Type `m`, press [enter]
1. Enter the number of mentions you wish to display, press [enter],
1. Read the screen.

A mention *display* is a list of posts, the oldest at the top.  Each post contains the post ID, poster data, the time posted and the post text.  Now in colour.

Typing [enter] advances to the next post, `r` + [enter] replies to the post above the cursor using a slightly-modified version of the main 'reply' routine.

Here's a typical mention:

### `t = get home Timeline`:
Relatively easy to work with:

1. Type `t`, press [enter]
1. Enter the number of posts you wish to display, press [enter],
1. Read the screen.

A timeline *display* is a list of posts, the oldest at the top.  Each post contains the post ID, poster data, the time posted and the post text.  Now in colour.

Typing [enter] advances to the next post, `r` + [enter] replies to the post above the cursor using a slightly-modified version of the main 'reply' routine.

Here's a typical timeline:

**`Typing up my notes from today's absolutely magnificent tasting.`**    
**`The scores I gave to Ch√¢teau Palmer's 2007 and their Alter Ego 2010 are identical to Robert Parker's. Actually, a lot of my scores are unsettlingly similar to his. Freaky.`**

### Miscellaneous:

Please note there are not many helpful messages if 10cbazbt3.py gets things wrong.  I've tested the basics but it's very early days right now.

There is more to follow, but for now please take a look at the **[Technical document](/docs/30-technical.md)** - it is a placeholder for now.
