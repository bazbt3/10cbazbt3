# How to use 10cbazbt3.py

## First, Failure:
When interacting with the !0Cv4 server using 10cbazbt3, the server feedback appears to be gibberish.  *It's my fault entirely.*  In a nutshell, I'm currently unable to 'translate' the responses returned from the API into anything I can use **within the application.**  Is it text, is it JSON, is it human-readable?  It is all 3 - of course - but I'm a noob.  It's only a matter of time before it clicks into place though, right?

## Second, the Menu again:
````
10cbazbt3 menu:
  b = Blurb (social post)
  p = Post (blog post)
  m = Mentions
  r = Reply

  exit = Exit

Admin:
  sites =  Sites owned by user
  Login =  Login (deletes current auth token!)
  Logout = Logout (deletes current auth token!)

Choice?
````

Self-explanatory, right?
