# How to use 10cbazbt3.py

## The Menu:
````
10cbazbt3 menu:
  b = Blurb (social post)
  p = Post (blog post)
  m = Mentions
  r = Reply

  exit = Exit

Admin:
  sites =  Sites owned by user
  Login =  Login (deletes current auth token!)
  Logout = Logout (deletes current auth token!)

Choice?
````

Self-explanatory, right?  No, not yet.

## A brief primer:

### `b = Blurb (social post)`:
Easy:

1. Type `b`, press [enter],
1. Read the prompt, write some text, press [enter],
1. The post appears at 10C.

---

### `p = Post (blog post)`:
Not quite as straightforward as a Blurb:

1. Type `p`, press [enter],
1. Read the first prompt, write a blog post title, press [enter],
1. Read the second prompt, write some text, some more text, press [enter] as many times as you like - *entry continues,*
1. **To post your text**, ensure your cursor is on a blank line and press [ctrl-d].

#### Before blogging for the first time:
Important: Please read through the code comments.  The code is currently tailored specifically to *my* Raspberry Pi's folder structure.  It's also setup to post to only *my* blog - see the 'post' subroutine for the variable to edit - *after* running **'sites'** and examining the API feedback.

---

### `m = Mentions`:
Somewhat hard to work with:

1. Type `m`, press [enter]
1. Enter the number of mentions you wish to display, press [enter],
1. Read the screen.

A mention *display* is currently made up of 2 sections: the pretty-printed JSON from the API followed by a list of posts = oldest at the top.  Each post contains the post ID, poster data, the time posted and the post text.

Here's a typical post:

I get the impression that @bazbt3 does not want to say certain words around his kids when talking about the wonderful diversity of life â€¦ :P

Right now there is no database behind this, nor any means of paging through a list of mentions.  Please scroll!

### `r = Reply`:
Reply comes after 'mentions' here for 2 reasons:

* Mentions is *very* incomplete.  It now returns a post id, unformatted poster id, and the post text.
* The 10C site Blurbs screen currently has an anchor with each post - hovering over it gives a post number.  Use that until this application works!

1. Type `r`, press [enter],
1. Read the prompt,
1. Enter the post number you wish to reply to,
1. Write some text, press [enter].

---

### `exit = Exit`:
Easy.

1. Type `exit`, press [enter], the application ends.

---

## The Admin menu:

### `sites =  Sites owned by user`:
Occasionally useful:

1. Type `sites`: it returns details of the sites, channels owned by the application's current user.

---

### `Login =  Login (deletes current auth token!)`:
Needs concentration:

1. Type `Login`,
1. Enter the account email address,
1. Enter the account password,
1. Read the prompt,
1. Check the application is logged in.

---

### `Logout = Logout (deletes current auth token!)`
Easy:

1. Type `Logout`.
1. Check that the application has logged out.

---

### Miscellaneous:

Please note there are not many helpful messages if 10cbazbt3.py gets things wrong.  I've tested the basics but it's very early days right now.

There is more to follow, but for now please take a look at the **[Technical document](/docs/30-technical.md)** - it is a placeholder for now.
